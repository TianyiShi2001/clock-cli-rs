//! # clock-cli-rs
//!
//! Command line clock utilities, with TUI interfaces, implemented in Rust. Currently, these features are implemented:
//!
//! - Stopwatch
//!   - start/pause/stop: ‚úÖ
//!   - lap time (similar to iOS's stopwatch's behaviour): ‚úÖ
//!   - report of all pause/start/lap instances (moments): WIP
//! - (Countdown) Timer
//!   - basics: ‚úÖ
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! If you are a Rustacean ü¶ÄÔ∏è, just `cargo install clock-cli`.
//!
//! Other installation methods: WIP
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ## Stopwatch:
//!
//! simply run:
//!
//! ```
//! clock
//! ```
//!
//! - Press `Space` to pause/resume.
//! - Press `l` to lap.
//! - Press `return` to finish.
//!
//! ## Countdown Timer:
//!
//! Specify the duration (in natual language) to run a countdown.
//!
//! Examples:
//!
//! ```
//! clock 3 minutes
//! clock 4h3m
//! clock 1 day
//! ```
//!
//! - Press `Space` to pause/resume.
//! - Press `return` to cancel.
//!
//! # Compatibility
//!
//! Currently only works on Linux and MacOS.
//!
//! # Acknowledgement
//!
//! The TUI is based on the [**cursive**](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) crate made by [Alexandre Bury (@glycos)](https://github.com/gyscos), who also helped me a lot during the development of this crate (see [glycose/cursive/#503](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive/pull/503))
