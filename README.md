# clock-cli-rs

Command line clock utilities, with TUI interfaces, implemented in Rust. Currently, these features are implemented:

- Stopwatch
  - start/pause/stop: ‚úÖ
  - lap time (similar to iOS's stopwatch's behaviour): ‚úÖ
  - report of all pause/start/lap instances (moments): WIP
- (Countdown) Timer
  - basics: ‚úÖ

# Installation

If you are a Rustacean ü¶ÄÔ∏è, just `cargo install clock-cli`.

Other installation methods: WIP

# Usage

## Stopwatch:

simply run:

```

```

- Press `Space` to pause/resume.
- Press `l` to lap. Mouse-scroll or press arrow keys to view more.

## Countdown Timer:

Specify the duration (in natual language) to run a countdown.

Examples:

```

- Press `return` to cancel.

# Compatibility

Currently only works on Linux and MacOS.

# Acknowledgement

The TUI is based on the [**cursive**](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) crate made by [Alexandre Bury (@glycos)](https://github.com/gyscos), who also helped me a lot during the development of this crate (see [glycose/cursive/#503](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive/pull/503))
